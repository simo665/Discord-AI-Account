# Discord AI-SELF-BOT

___

## Introduction 
Hello, this repository files will make you able to make your a human (not a discord bot) discord account to respond to users automatically using llm (Large language models) through Groq API. 

## Note:
Note that the bot will take a brief delay before starting to type, mimicking human behavior. The delay is randomized between 5–10 seconds before it starts typing, and an additional 3–8 seconds during typing.
