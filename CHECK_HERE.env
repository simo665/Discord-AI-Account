# Your groq api will be here, past it in any slot, adding multiple APIs from multiple groq accounts will make you able to bypass the rate limits.
# Get an api key from here: https://console.groq.com/keys
# NOTE: 
# • One Groq api is pretty enough but if you found yours self-bot getting rate limited a lot you might want another Groq API to switch it if your previous api is rate limited.
# • Get an api from different account otherwise it will be useless if from the same account and you'll have to wait the rate limits.
# • If you created an API from different accounts with the same api your organization will be restricted by the Groq due to a violation of terms of service. so make sure to use vpn with a new IP-Address for every account you will create.
